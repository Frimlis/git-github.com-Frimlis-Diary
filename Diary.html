        <h1>THIS BLOG WILL BE ABOUT ME AND MY FIRST ATTEMPS IN WEB</h1>
        <h2>Today we will start making some kind of diary. Every day I would try to write something and improve my blog</h2>
        <h1>Day 1 08.02.2022</h1>
        <p>So, I have many things I stop for now with him. Should probably stat trying make some shop, can start with pure front site and try adding some work with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Books:getting started HTML/CSS, Eloquent Javascript, HTML and CSS</li>
            <li>Onlain free sites: as Mozilla, freecodecamp, learn javascript, w3schools</li>
            <li>Youtube videous</li>
        </ul>
        <p>That should be enough to learn about basic things I guess. Today I finally learn how to center div elements, at least one way to do it.<br>
            I probably should start learning how use git to save and track my progress, also it will be nice to see full green screen half year later.</p>
            <p>So, apparently github desktop really do me more harm than good, so I try to completely uninstall it and start new.</p>
            <p>Alright so I just drag everything in new repository from my desktop now I just need to figure out how to link and push changes</p>
            <p>idk man</p>
            <p>Well every time I try to link existing repository with new on my desk programm just create new repository, idk what I do wrong but I guess it will work for now/</p>

        <h1>Day 2 09.02.2022</h1>
        <p>I think its important to acquire self discipline, good start will be post something every day</p>
        <p>Also, there is some cool learning method called POMIDOR, basically you set timer every 25 minutes and dont get distracted during it</p>
        <p>I think good start for me will be 1-2 POMIDOR every day in the evening after main work. 1 POMIDOR for teory and 1 for practice sounds right. </p>
        <p>I wonder if I stop for now with him. Should probably stat trying make some shop, can start with pure front site and try adding some make something like this myself?</p>
        <p>Sooo what to do? I need some pet projects or else learning became boring and I eventually drop it.</p>
        <p>There many cool stuff that you stop for now with him. Should probably stat trying make some shop, can start with pure front site and try adding some do with JS, but I think my first attemps should use pure html/css, just to getting to basics.</p>
        <p>Since there not much stuff that you stop for now with him. Should probably stat trying make some shop, can start with pure front site and try adding some do with it I think one should be alright.<br> 
        Something like page for something cool? Yeah, lets make separate page about Dipodidae, I will make this blog cooler later, i promise...
        </p>
        <h1>Day 5 12.02.2022</h1>
        <p>Kinda forgot write in diary, too focused on improving my <a href="Dipodidae/Dipodidae.html">Dipodidae</a> page, 
            I think Im started to get familiar with the feel of html and css.
            </p>
            <p>maybe I should pick one of classic basic templates for html, try to do it myself and move to js already. </p>
        <h1>Day 7 14.02.2022</h1>
        <p>Today I think Im just gonna only read about JS, probably skip practice, first I planning to make something simple like calculator or compare numbers but I stuck between
            teory of Js and its realisation using Forms.
        </p>
        <h1>Day 21 28.02.2022</h1>
        <p>What a mad world we live in. Unbelievable.</p>
        <h1>Day 28 07.03.2022</h1>
        <p>It keep getting worst</p>
        <h1>Day 59 07.04.2022</h1>
        <p>Make some nice progress with calculator(html/css still feel stiff and I keep screwing js scripts sometimes, but well). <br>
            I think I should stop for now with him. Should probably start trying make some shop, there so many good exercizes and ideas<br> 
            can start with pure front site and try adding some functionality while learning about backend.</p>
        <h1>Day 70 18.04.2022</h1>

        <h1>19.05.2022</h1>
