        <h1>THIS BLOG WILL BE ABOUT ME AND MY FIRST ATTEMPS IN WEB</h1>
        <h2>Today we will start making some kind of diary. Every day I would try to write something and improve my blog</h2>
        <h1>Day 1 08.02.2022</h1>
        <p>So, I have many things I can work with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Books:getting started HTML/CSS, Eloquent Javascript, HTML and CSS</li>
            <li>Onlain free sites: as Mozilla, freecodecamp, learn javascript, w3schools</li>
            <li>Youtube videous</li>
        </ul>
        <p>That should be enough to learn about basic things I guess. Today I finally learn how to center div elements, at least one way to do it.
            I probably should start learning how use git to save and track my progress, also it will be nice to see full green screen half year later.</p>
            <p>So, apparently github desktop really do me more harm than good, so I try to completely uninstall it and start new.</p>
            <p>Alright so I just drag everything in new repository from my desktop now I just need to figure out how to link and push changes</p>
            <p>idk man</p>
