        <h1>THIS BLOG WILL BE ABOUT ME AND MY FIRST ATTEMPS IN WEB</h1>
        <h2>Today we will start making some kind of diary. Every day I would try to write something and improve my blog</h2>
        <h1>Day 1 08.02.2022</h1>
        <p>So, I have many things I can work with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Books:getting started HTML/CSS, Eloquent Javascript, HTML and CSS</li>
            <li>Onlain free sites: as Mozilla, freecodecamp, learn javascript, w3schools</li>
            <li>Youtube videous</li>
        </ul>
        <p>That should be enough to learn about basic things I guess. Today I finally learn how to center div elements, at least one way to do it.
            I probably should start learning how use git to save and track my progress, also it will be nice to see full green screen half year later.</p>
            <p>So, apparently github desktop really do me more harm than good, so I try to completely uninstall it and start new.</p>
            <p>Alright so I just drag everything in new repository from my desktop now I just need to figure out how to link and push changes</p>
            <p>idk man</p>
            <p>Well every time I try to link existing repository with new on my desk programm just create new repository, idk what I do wrong but I guess it will work for now/</p>

        <h1>Day 2 09.02.2022</h1>
        <p>I think its important to acquire self discipline, good start will be post something every day</p>
        <p>Also, there is some cool learning method called POMIDOR, basically you set timer every 25 minutes and dont get distracted during it</p>
        <p>I think good start for me will be 1-2 POMIDOR every day in the evening after main work. 1 POMIDOR for teory and 1 for practice sounds right. </p>
        <p>I wonder if I can make something like this myself?</p>
        <p>Sooo what to do? I need some pet projects or else learning became boring and I eventually drop it.</p>
        <p>There many cool stuff that you can do with JS, but I think my first attemps should use pure html/css, just to getting to basics.</p>
        <p>Since there not much stuff that you can do with it I think one should be alright.<br> 
        Something like page for something cool? Yeah, lets make separate page about Dipodidae, I will make this blog cooler later, i promise...
